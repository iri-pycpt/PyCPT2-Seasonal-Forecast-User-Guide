# Forecast maps

The **Forecast Maps** section plots the calibrated forecasts in deterministic and probabilistic formats.   

The **deterministic** maps show forecast anomalies, here from the GEFS model.

These maps indicate the "best guess" which is often very close to the climatological average.
However, perhaps counterintuitively, this does *not* mean that the climatological average is the most likely outcome. 
The same forecast is presented probabilistically below, in terms of the probability of the rainfall falling in each of three tercile categories: Below normal, Near normal, and Above normal.
