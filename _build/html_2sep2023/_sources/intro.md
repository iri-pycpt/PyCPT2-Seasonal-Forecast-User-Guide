Welcome to __PyCPT Version 2.5 for Seasonal Climate Forecasts!__ The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to
 configure and run PyCPT, Version 2.5+, in order to make, calibrate and verify
multi-model seasonal forecasts of precipitation based on the [NOAA North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) ](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/NMME/)
 and European [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) ](https://climate.copernicus.eu) databases, obtained from [IRI Data Library](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu). PyCPT helps to implement the [NextGen approach](nextgen-section-label) using the [Climate Predictability Tool (CPT)](cpt-section-label).

 
The PyCPT set-up and results are illustrated for a West African precipitation forecast example for Jun-Sep 2023, initialized in May 2023. The example uses a two-model multimodel ensemble of the NCEP CFSv2 and ECMWF SEAS5 models.

```{admonition} PyCPT 2.5 is:
- a rewrite of PyCPT based on [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) and a [new set of Python libraries](https://github.com/iri-pycpt) that provide a Python interface to the CPT fortran-based package, and facilitate access to GCM forecasts/hindcasts and observational gridded datasets via [IRI Data Library](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu)
- designed to be run natively using Python on linux, Windows and Mac 
- easily installed by downloading a python conda environment file for your platform
- easily customizable  to individual forecaster needs using Jupyter Notebooks
- enables the use of observational predictand gridded datasets, such as [ENACTS,](https://iri.columbia.edu/resources/enacts/) from the userâ€™s laptop in  CPTv10.tsv format. 
```

 __Who is this guide for?__
 
Basic familiarity with Python, seasonal climate forecasting, and IRI's [Climate Predictability Tool (CPT)](http://iri.columbia.edu/tools/) is assumed.
